# Auction Smart Contract

This is a basic implementation of an auction smart contract in Rust. The smart contract allows users to list items, place bids, update item descriptions, and stop item listings. It also includes basic security checks and data structures for managing users and bids.

## Getting Started

To run this smart contract, you'll need Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is installed, you can compile and run the smart contract as follows:

```bash
cargo run
